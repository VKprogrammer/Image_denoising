Report and colab book uploaded showing my work.


Along with PRID NET model i also tried MIR-Net and DCE-Net Model . i attached colab books of both of them u can see work and results.

NOTE: if due to some reason my script is not working plz do required chanegs in main file and run it , i tested it in collab and it was working fine.
